- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
You might do this in order to have more control over the app in each stage of the lifecycle process.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
The render method tells React what to display on the screen.
The constructor function creates components.
The componentDidMount method ensures that the component has the necessary state to run correctly.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
Custom hooks allow developers to reuse stateful logic, rather than repeating lines of code for every function or component that may need to perform similar tasks.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
All apps are tested eventually, but it is better to test the app in-house during the development process in order to identify and resolve bugs, rather than have your users encounter bugs after public release.
